	<h2>HOW IT WORKS
	</h2>
	<p> Distinguish yourself by completing evaluations for companies you admire. Receive feedback directly from the person that matters - your next boss. When a position opens, you'll be the first person they call for an interview.

	<p>Designed to give the employer a sense of your skills or values, evaluations will be either technical or cultural. Receive prompt feedback on a scale of 1-5, where 1 represents "would not consider this applicant for any positions" and 5 represents "will call this applicant for an interview as soon as the need arises."
